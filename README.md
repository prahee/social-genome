In my “Social Genome Project,” I developed a statistical framework to characterize the distinct social architectures of universities by modeling their student friendship networks as realizations from Exponential-Family Random Graph Models (ERGMs). I estimated generative models for Caltech, Dartmouth, and Cornell using the facebook100 dataset and treated node-level attributes (e.g., class year, major, and residential affiliation) as explanatory covariates influencing edge formation. By comparing fitted ERGMs across institutions, I quantified how different structural and attribute-driven mechanisms, such as assortative mixing by major or homophily within residential systems, differentially shaped each network’s topology. The resulting models reveal interpretable parameters that serve as proxies for a university’s “social genes,” which allows formal comparison of community structure, clustering tendencies, and mixing patterns. This approach provides a quantitative way of looking at campus culture and a tool for assessing institutional influence on student social integration.
